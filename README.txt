Included Files
pittar.c
header.h
compress.c
dir0
Makefile
zll1_project3_writeup.pdf

to Run:
type make if none of the files have been compiled yet
	- if they have remove the executables first
run on command line with ./pittar -option -.pittfilename -hierarchy name
	- only include arguments that are needed

Comments:
I chose to ignore the -j option because I didn't think it was necessary. Also, my program cannot append or compress more than one hierarchy. It just handles a single directory hierarchy.
I'm pretty sure this wont work on thot or unix either... ill be demoing it on my machine
